**Real-Time Accent Translation System for Conference Calls**

---

## <a name="objectives"></a> Objectives
- **Primary Objective**:  
  Develop a real-time accent translation system that improves communication during conference calls by translating accents.

- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Implement Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion.
  - Modify the text to match the recipient's accent using phonetic processing.
  - Convert processed text into speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
  - Ensure real-time streaming for live audio.

## <a name="methodology"></a> Methodology
The methodology is broken down into multiple stages to handle the real-time translation of accents:

- Speech Recognition (STT):
  Tools: Google Speech-to-Text API, Mozilla DeepSpeech
 Convert spoken words into text in real-time.

- Text Processing (Accent Translation):
  Tools: Phonetisaurus, NLTK, spaCy
  Modify the text to match the target accentâ€™s phonetic rules.

- Text-to-Speech (TTS):
  Tools: Google TTS, Mozilla TTS
  Convert the processed text back into speech with the desired accent.

- Real-Time Streaming:
  Tools: WebRTC, Socket.IO
  Ensure real-time communication with minimal latency using streaming technologies
